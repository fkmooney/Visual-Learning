# Visual Learning

#### a gallery of images generated through learning code

This is a collection of images I've generated while learning how to code visualizations. Some are based on tutorials or works of others to figure out certain concepts, others are original.

Materials: line, curves, shapes, colors, inputs (photos)
Tools: tiling, displacement, repetition, recursion, algorithms
